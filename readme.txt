This plugin creates a widget which will load random quotes or testimonials from a text file via JQuery.

== Description ==

This plugin creates a widget which loads quotes from a normal text file located in the plugin directory via JQuery.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip and upload the folder `arrjs` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Edit the text file "quotes.txt". Each quote should be seperated by an @ symbol at the end of the quote.
4. Place the widget (through the Widgets link in the 'Appearance' menu).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I add this widget =

Do you have a theme that is compatible with widgets? If not, there are many easy to follow tutorials on how to make
your theme widget compatible. Check with your favorite search engine.

Did you activate the plugin?

Did you place the widget?

= What version of Wordpress is required to run this? =

The plugin has been tested to work with WordPress 3.0.1. Other versions are likely to work if they support widgets.

= Why aren't the quotes appearing even though the widget is enabled? =

* jQuery is required in your template for this widget to work. Your theme might not include jQuery.
* THIS PLUGIN ASSUMES NORMAL INSTALLATION PATHS. If you're operating WP somewhere other than base domains
or subdomains, the plugin might not work.

= Why is it named arrjs? =

I needed a catchy name. I was thinking "random JS," but that was too generic. I then shortened it to RJS,
and as I wrote that out, I spelled it out loud. "R. J. S." That "r" sounded like a pirate saying ARRRRR,
and the rest is history.

= Are you going to support this widget / plugin? =

At some point, maybe. For now, its released as-is, because it suits my needs 100%, and I'm sure someone else out
there wants to use this plugin. Right now, I have very little grasp of jQuery.

== Screenshots ==

Currently there are no screenshots. There are no plugin options other than title, and no inherent styles.
This plugin should be self explanatory.

== Other Notes ==
